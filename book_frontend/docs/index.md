# Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum for developing AI-powered humanoid robots. This program covers all aspects of humanoid robot development, from foundational ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI integration and autonomous behavior.

## Course Overview

This curriculum is structured as four interconnected modules that build upon each other to create complete, autonomous humanoid systems:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/ros2-robotics-module)

Learn how ROS 2 functions as the communication middleware connecting all robot components. Understand node-based communication patterns, Python agents with rclpy, and humanoid modeling with URDF.

**Key Topics:**
- ROS 2 Foundations: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Python Agents and ROS Control with rclpy
- Humanoid Modeling with URDF

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/digital-twin-sim)

Explore physics-based simulation and virtual environments for humanoid robots. Master Gazebo for physics simulation, Unity for high-fidelity interaction, and simulated sensors.

**Key Topics:**
- Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- High-Fidelity Interaction in Unity
- Simulated Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/ai-robot-brain)

Discover high-performance AI perception, navigation, and training systems. Learn NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS accelerated perception, and Nav2 for humanoid path planning.

**Key Topics:**
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data Generation
- Isaac ROS: Accelerated Perception and VSLAM
- Nav2 for Humanoid Path Planning

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/vla-integration)

Connect perception, language, and action in humanoid robots. Implement voice-to-action systems, LLM-based cognitive planning, and integrate all components into a complete autonomous system.

**Key Topics:**
- Voice-to-Action with Speech Recognition
- LLM-Based Cognitive Planning for Robots
- Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Learning Path

We recommend following the modules in sequence to build a comprehensive understanding:

1. **Start with Module 1** to establish your ROS 2 foundation
2. **Continue with Module 2** to learn simulation and testing
3. **Advance to Module 3** to develop AI perception capabilities
4. **Complete with Module 4** to integrate all components into an autonomous system

## Target Audience

This curriculum is designed for:
- AI engineers integrating LLMs with embodied robotic systems
- Robotics developers simulating humanoids before real-world deployment
- Advanced robotics and AI practitioners working on perception and navigation
- Students and researchers entering humanoid robot control

## Success Metrics

Upon completing this curriculum, you will be able to:
- Design and implement ROS 2-based humanoid robot systems
- Create and validate robot behaviors in simulation environments
- Integrate AI perception and navigation systems
- Build autonomous robots that respond to natural language commands

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Programming experience in Python
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of 3D geometry and kinematics (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/ros2-robotics-module) to establish the foundational concepts needed for the entire curriculum.
