# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm represents the integration of perception, language understanding, and physical action in humanoid robots. This module explores how to connect these three modalities to create robots that can understand natural language commands, perceive their environment, and execute appropriate actions in a coordinated manner.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the VLA system architecture connecting perception, language, and action
- Learn how to convert voice commands to robot actions
- Design end-to-end autonomous humanoid workflows
- Implement cognitive planning systems using LLMs

## Table of Contents

1. [Voice-to-Action with Speech Recognition](./voice-to-action)
2. [LLM-Based Cognitive Planning for Robots](./llm-planning)
3. [Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid](./autonomous-humanoid)

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI engineers integrating large language models (LLMs) with embodied robotic systems. It emphasizes system-level explanations over code-level implementations.

## Chapter Previews

### Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action with Speech Recognition
This chapter covers how to process voice commands through speech recognition to generate executable robot actions.

### Chapter 2: LLM-Based Cognitive Planning for Robots
This chapter explores using large language models for high-level cognitive planning and task decomposition in robotic systems.

### Chapter 3: Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid
This chapter integrates all VLA components into a complete autonomous humanoid system that can understand natural language commands and execute complex behaviors.

## Success Criteria

- Readers understand VLA system architecture connecting perception, language, and action
- Readers can explain how voice commands are converted to robot actions
- Readers can describe end-to-end autonomous humanoid workflows
