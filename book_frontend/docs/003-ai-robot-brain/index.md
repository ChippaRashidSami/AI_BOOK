# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

NVIDIA Isaac provides high-performance tools for AI perception, navigation, and training of humanoid robots. This module explores the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, including Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, Isaac ROS for accelerated perception, and Nav2 integration for advanced navigation.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the value of photorealistic simulation for AI training
- Master Isaac ROS accelerated perception and VSLAM pipelines
- Apply Nav2 for humanoid path planning and navigation
- Design system architectures for AI-driven robotics

## Table of Contents

1. [NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data Generation](./isaac-sim)
2. [Isaac ROS: Accelerated Perception and VSLAM](./isaac-ros)
3. [Nav2 for Humanoid Path Planning](./nav2-path-planning)

## Target Audience

This module is designed for advanced robotics and AI practitioners working on perception and navigation systems. It emphasizes system architecture and data flow patterns rather than low-level implementation details.
