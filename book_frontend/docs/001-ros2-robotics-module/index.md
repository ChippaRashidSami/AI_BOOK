# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the communication middleware for humanoid robots, functioning as the "nervous system" that enables different components of the robot to communicate, coordinate, and operate effectively. This module will provide foundational understanding of ROS 2's role in connecting robot components, node-based communication patterns, and humanoid modeling through URDF.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand ROS 2's role as a robotic nervous system connecting different robot components
- Master node-based communication patterns (nodes, topics, services)
- Learn how URDF defines humanoid robot structure
- Gain practical knowledge of Python agents and ROS control with rclpy

## Table of Contents

1. [ROS 2 Foundations: Nodes, Topics, and Services](./ros2-foundations)
2. [Python Agents and ROS Control with rclpy](./python-ros-control)
3. [Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./humanoid-modeling)

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI engineers and robotics students entering humanoid robot control. It provides essential conceptual knowledge and practical skills for working with ROS 2 in humanoid robot applications.

## Chapter Previews

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Foundations: Nodes, Topics, and Services
This chapter covers the foundational concepts of ROS 2 architecture, explaining how nodes communicate through topics and services, and how this creates an effective communication infrastructure for humanoid robots.

### Chapter 2: Python Agents and ROS Control with rclpy
This chapter explores how Python can be used to interface with ROS 2 systems using the rclpy client library, enabling AI engineers to create intelligent agents that can control humanoid robots.

### Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF
This chapter explains how URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) defines the physical structure, joints, and kinematics of humanoid robots, providing the necessary foundation for control and simulation.

## Success Criteria
